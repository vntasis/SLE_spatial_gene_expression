- DCE_detection: Contains all the scripts required for the identification of DCEs, 
i.e. the detection of their boundary coordinates,
starting from the whole blood expression profile (RNAseq) dataset of the cohort (148 SLE patients and 52 healthy individuals).
The "main.R" script is the one containing the pipeline and the rest of them define helper functions.
- DCE_analysis: Includes the code utilized in the analysis of the detected DCEs in our dataset, 
from calculating statistics about them to the identification of disruptor genes.
